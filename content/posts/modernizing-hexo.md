Five years ago, I set up a Hexo blog. It served me well, but as I enter my final year of university, I felt the need for something that better represents my current technical skills.

## Why the Change?

The old Hexo setup was functional, but it had several limitations:

- **Outdated dependencies**: The theme and plugins were no longer maintained
- **Limited customization**: Making design changes required diving deep into EJS templates
- **No type safety**: Everything was JavaScript with no compile-time checks

## The New Stack

I decided to rebuild from scratch using modern tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **React 19** | UI components with hooks |
| **TypeScript** | Type safety and better DX |
| **Vite** | Lightning-fast builds |
| **Bun** | Fast package manager and runtime |
| **Framer Motion** | Smooth animations |

## Design Philosophy

I went with a **Neo-brutalist + Bento Box** aesthetic because:

1. It's bold and memorable
2. It reflects my interest in both low-level systems and high-level design
3. It stands out from typical developer portfolios

## What's Next?

- Add more articles from my old blog
- Implement a proper search functionality
- Add RSS feed support
- Dark mode toggle

Stay tuned for more updates!
